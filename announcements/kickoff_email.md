## Kickoff Invitation: R for Data Science Community 🚀

Dear Team,

I’m excited to invite you to a new initiative we’re launching — a daily **R for Data Science Community**!

Whether you're an analyst, a curious learner, or someone who’s never written a line of code, this is your chance to build foundational skills in data science using R.

We’ll use the free book *R for Data Science (2nd Edition)* and the new **Positron IDE** to guide us through hands-on, bite-sized learning sessions. Each day, we’ll gather for **30–45 minutes** to explore, practice, and grow together.

### Why join?
- 🌱 Learn R from scratch — no prior experience needed
- 🧠 Build real data skills that apply to healthcare analytics
- 🤝 Connect with peers and grow a data-driven culture
- 🎯 Work on mini-projects using real healthcare data

**Kickoff:** [Insert Date & Time]  
**Location:** [Insert Room or Link]  
**Bring:** Your laptop and curiosity!

Let’s build something impactful together — one line of code at a time.

Warm regards,  
Raed Alotaibi
